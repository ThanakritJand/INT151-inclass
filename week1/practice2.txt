Reverse the Words in a Sentence
Write a function that takes a sentence (string) and returns a new sentence with the order of the words reversed. Handle the following edge cases:
If the input is undefined, null, or not a string, return an empty string "".

If the input string is empty, return an empty string "".

Words should be reversed by order, not by reversing the letters inside them.

Keep punctuation and spacing attached to the words as they appear (no cleaning required).

Examples:
reverseWords("The quick brown fox") should return "fox brown quick The".

reverseWords("JavaScript is fun") should return "fun is JavaScript".

reverseWords("Hi") should return "Hi".

reverseWords("Well, this is unexpected!") should return "unexpected! is this Well,".

reverseWords("") should return "".

reverseWords(undefined) should return "".

reverseWords(null) should return "".

reverseWords(12345) should return "".

reverseWords(["not", "a", "string"]) should return "".
