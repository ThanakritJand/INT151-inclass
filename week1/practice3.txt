Sum All Numbers in a Sentence
Write a function that takes a sentence (string) and returns the sum of all numbers found in it. Handle the following edge cases:
If the input is undefined, null, or not a string, return 0.

If the input string is empty, return 0.

Numbers can be integers or decimals, positive or negative.

Words and punctuation should be ignored (only actual numbers count).
